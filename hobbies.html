<h4>I also enjoy playing video games (although of course, not too often!) A few games I enjoy playing are: </h4>

<h1 class = "game-names">Osu!</h1>

<img class = "gamepic" src="osu.jpg" alt="">

<p class = "gamedesc">Osu! is a free rhythm game that incorporates aim and speed. I first started playing casually but eventually came to really love this game! It has a fullblown ranking system with about 2 million users signed up and right now I'm about 17,000th in the world. If you ever start playing, make sure to friend me! Here's my profile: <a href = "https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14533822">ReigenATK</a>. To learn more about the game, go <a href = "https://osu.ppy.sh/home">here.</a> To see high level gameplay by one of the best Osu! players in the world, click <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AYkfX2KZfs">here.</a></p>

<h1 class = "game-names">League of Legends</h1>

<img class = "gamepic" src="lol.jpg" alt="">

<p class = "gamedesc">League of Legends is perhaps the most popular MOBA to date, with millions of players across 13 servers. I first started playing in 2017 and although I don't play as much anymore, it still brings a lot of good memories to me as I keep up with the professional scene (Go TSM!). I would recommend anyone to try and start playing, but I do warn that it is very addictive!</p>
